# MicSpectrumApp
JavaScript application for inspecting spectra of recorded sounds

Uses the Web Audio and MediaRecorder APIs, FFT code adapted from https://www.nayuki.io/page/free-small-fft-in-multiple-languages and some code from AudioRecorder https://github.com/cwilso/AudioRecorder

Tested in Chrome, and access to microphone requires a secure connection (https) or manual override.
